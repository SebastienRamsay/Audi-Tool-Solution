# Audi-Tool-Solution
A Tool Organization Solution for Audi West Ottawa

Audi West Ottawa used a handmade spreadsheet to keep track of where each tool was in the shop. I created a program to scrape correct tool numbers and descriptions along with images from audi.snapon.com. I used this information to merge the existing data into a database with the scraped data. I then made 2 applications, one for viewing and manipulating the data and one for organizing the tools. This gives the shop information like tools not found and tools to be moved. I also added features to allow the database to be converted into a spreadsheet, darkmode, and a fix images button that would automatically search for tools without images in the database and make an attempt to scrape those images.
